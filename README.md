## Overview

This is a service designed for quickly booking available slots for road tests for a driver's license using a Telegram bot. The service automates the process of checking and booking available slots for road tests, removing the need for manually checking websites every few minutes.

The service uses **Selenium** to interact with the booking website and logs all activity. You can configure various steps of the booking process in a configuration file to adapt it to different services.

## üì¶ Features

### Automated Booking

![Booking Process](link-to-your-booking-process-screenshot)

The bot checks for available time slots for road tests on the official booking website and sends them directly to your Telegram.

### Custom Data Input

![User Data Input](link-to-your-user-data-input-screenshot)

Users input their details such as name, document number, postal code, and date of birth through the bot.

### Periodic Slot Checking

Once the details are submitted, the service periodically checks the booking service at a predefined interval for available time slots.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User Data Input**: Users enter their information via the Telegram bot, including document number and postal code.
   
2. **Slot Search**: The service uses Selenium to browse the website and search for available slots at regular intervals.

3. **Notifications**: When available slots are found, users receive updates directly in their Telegram chat.

4. **Logging**: All actions, searches, and responses are logged to ensure transparency.

5. **Configurable**: Through a configuration file, the system can easily be adapted for other booking services with minimal code changes.
